    This work main objectives were to develop the simples possible attitude and motion capture system for autonomous robot systems using a low-cost inertial measuring unit.
    The most straightforward mathematical approach available in the literatura were employed to develop two pieces of software that implements the equations.
    We developed one driver and one application that control the MPU6050 sensors and implements Euler's equations of motion, respectively, for attitude and motion capture.
    Benchmark tests were run to show the usefulness and suitability of the materials and methods for the aforementioned purposes.
    In the end, results showing the limitations of the means employed were discussed, with mention to alternative approaches which could offer better results.
